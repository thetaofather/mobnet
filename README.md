<h1 align="center">Turning dTAO Volatility into Mob Hits</h1>

## Intro

Welcome to **San Taovanni** — a mob-run district inside Tensor City.

**The Taofather** is a mob-themed Bittensor subnet where volatility becomes a public game: **Bosses** post hits, **Mobsters** form crews, and **Consiglieres** keep the books.

The Family’s currency is **MOB-α** (“Mob Alpha”). Use it to sponsor jobs, earn envelopes, climb ranks, and build a reputation that lives on the **Hit Board**.

> **Important:** Any TAO-equivalent examples use a reference input `p_alpha` for accounting. It’s not a peg and not a guarantee — it’s just the “street price” input used to compare values.

## The Game Loop

1) **A Boss** picks a target subnet and posts a job on the **Hit Board**  
2) Boss posts **two deposits** to open the hit:
   - **MOB-α deposit** `A_boss` (Street Tax Hold + Family Vault + Washable Escrow)
   - **Target alpha deposit** `X_boss` (target subnet alpha that will be sold in the hit)
3) **Mobsters** (miners) join by depositing the target subnet’s alpha into the pool  
4) **Heat Window** ends → the pool is evaluated against the Boss’s **fill thresholds**  
   - Too little crew → **REFUND**
   - Enough crew → **ARMED**
5) If **ARMED**, the protocol executes **one batched sell** (“the hit”) at a **random time** inside an **Execution Window** (anti-gaming)
   - Earliest: **15 minutes** after arming
   - Latest: **7200 minutes (5 days)** after arming
6) TAO proceeds split into: **Taofather take**, **Boss Kickback**, **Pool Payout**  
7) Consiglieres compute **Street Heat** and publish the dossier  
8) Boss MOB-α escrow is “washed” back (bounded), with a loss split **burn + blessing**  
9) Participants earn **Envelope** rewards (MOB-α) weighted by **contribution + reputation**  
10) The job becomes lore: **BOTCHED / MESSY / CLEAN / LEGENDARY**, ranks, Families, leaderboards

Hit Status Lifecycle:

| Status     | When it happens                                                               | What it means (1 sentence)                                                              | Can deposits change?                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **OPEN**   | Immediately after Boss posts the job                                          | Hit is in the **Heat Window** collecting target-alpha deposits.                         | **Yes** (Boss + Mobsters can deposit) |
| **ARMED**  | After Heat Window ends **and** thresholds allow execution                     | Hit is **locked** and will execute **once** at a **random time** inside `E_min..E_max`. | **No** (inventory frozen)             |
| **REFUND** | After Heat Window ends and `F < θ_refund` (or Boss-selected refund condition) | Hit is canceled: deposits return; Boss pays the cancel fee (if configured).             | **No**                                |
| **CLOSED** | After the randomized execution + settlement completes                         | Hit is finished, and the full dossier (payouts/heat/tag/proof) is published.            | **No**                                |

## Quick Rules (The Money)

### Two payouts, always separate

Every hit produces **two independent payouts**:

1) **TAO payout** (from selling pooled target alpha)  
   - **Strictly pro-rata by target alpha contributed to the hit**  
   - **Not** influenced by reputation, MOB-α, tags, or anything else

2) **MOB-α Envelope payout** (the “mining” reward)  
   - **Is** influenced by contribution **and** reputation (Rep)  
   - Boss gets a slight “neck bonus” weight on their target-alpha contribution  
   - Paid in MOB-α, not TAO

### What gets sold in a hit

A hit sells **only target subnet alpha**:
- Boss contributes `X_boss` target alpha (minus a small vault skim)
- Mobsters contribute `d_i` target alpha
- The protocol sells the combined inventory in one batched execution

**MOB-α is never converted** in the hit.

### TAO settlement from every hit

When a hit executes, it produces:

- `V_hit` (TAO proceeds)

From `V_hit`, the protocol takes:

- **Taofather take:** `t = 1.5%` (base; may increase slightly for underfilled execution)
- **Boss Kickback:** `b_eff(I', ρ)` (tag-based 1–3%, improved by Boss skin)
- The rest goes to the **Pool Payout** pot (paid strictly pro-rata by target alpha)

---

## Roles

### The Taofather (Subnet Owner)
Runs the city. Sets the street rules. Collects the take.

### Boss (Hit Sponsor)
Opens hits. Deposits MOB-α + real target alpha. Takes bounded wash risk on MOB-α. Earns kickback + TAO from their target alpha sale.

### Mobsters (Crew / Miners)
Bring inventory (target alpha). Get paid in TAO + envelopes (MOB-α). Build reputation.

### Consiglieres (Validators / Bookkeepers)
Compute Street Heat and Rep. Validate settlement math. Publish dossiers and leaderboards.

---

---

## Arming + Execution Window (Anti-Gaming)

To prevent timing games (sniping the last second, coordinating external liquidity, etc.), **hits do not execute at a known timestamp**.

We separate time into two phases:

### Phase A — Heat Window (Fill Phase)
During the Heat Window, deposits are allowed.

- Duration: `T_fill`
- Deposits allowed: Boss `X_boss`, Mobsters `d_i`
- At `T_fill` end, the pool is evaluated against **fill thresholds** chosen by the Boss (bounded by protocol limits)

Define:
- `C` = total pool capacity (in target alpha units)
- `Q_filled` = total target alpha deposited (Boss + Mobsters, after any vault skims)
- Fill ratio:

$$
F=\frac{Q_{filled}}{C}
$$

### Phase B — Execution Window (Armed Phase)

If the pool qualifies, it becomes **ARMED**:

- **Inventory is frozen** (no deposits, no withdrawals)
- The protocol executes **once** at a **random time** inside a fixed window:
  - **E_min = 15 minutes**
  - **E_max = 7200 minutes (5 days)**
- The **exact** execution time is **not disclosed** ahead of time—only the bounds.

> **Display rule:** The Hit Board shows “ARMED — executes sometime between **+15m** and **+7200m** after arming.”

## Hit Board Visibility (Obfuscated Until Execution)

To reduce gaming, coordination, and front-running, **active hits are obfuscated until the moment they execute**.

### What the public can see (before execution)
While a hit is **OPEN (filling)** or **ARMED (scheduled)**, the public Hit Board shows only:

- **Target subnet** (e.g., `T=1`)
- **Reason / thesis** (plain-English justification provided by the Boss)
- **Status**: OPEN or ARMED
- **Heat Window duration** (`T_fill`)
- **Execution Window bounds** (`E_min..E_max`) *(optional; can be shown as “executes within X–Y after arming”)*

> The goal is to communicate *why* a hit exists without revealing execution-critical details.

### What is hidden (until after execution)
Until the hit has executed, the following details are **not shown publicly**:

- Pool capacity `C` and current fill ratio `F`
- Exact thresholds (`θ_refund`, `θ_partial`, `θ_full`)
- Deposits / inventory (Boss `X_boss`, Mobsters `d_i`, and totals)
- Any per-wallet participation data
- The exact execution time (only the window bounds may be shown)

### After execution (full transparency)
Once the hit executes, the dossier becomes public and includes:

- Final inventory sold (`Q_filled`), participation breakdown, and proceeds `V_hit`
- take, kickback, pool pot, and strict pro-rata TAO payouts
- Street Heat `I'`, tag (BOTCHED/MESSY/CLEAN/LEGENDARY)
- Any refund / underfill penalties applied to the Boss
- The randomness proof / audit trail for `B_exec`

**Design intent:** *Hide what can be gamed, publish what can be audited.*

## Example Hit Board Cards (Pre vs Post)

Below is the same hit shown in two phases:
- **Pre-execution (Obfuscated):** what the public sees while OPEN/ARMED
- **Post-execution (Dossier):** what becomes public after the hit executes

---

## ✅ PRE-EXECUTION (OBFUSCATED) — Public Hit Board Card

### 🧾 Case File #071 — “The Dockside Dump.”
**Status:** 🟡 ARMED  
**Target:** Subnet `T=1` (`alpha_1`)  
**District:** San Taovanni — The Docks  

**Reason (Boss Thesis):**  
> “This subnet has shown repeated signs of thin liquidity and hype-driven pricing. The hit is intended to force faster price discovery and produce an auditable stress-test record.”

**Heat Window:** `T_fill = 2h 00m`  
**Execution:** Executes at a **random time** within the **Execution Window** after arming *(exact time not disclosed)*

**Public Notes:**
- Pool details are **obfuscated** until execution to reduce gaming/front-running.
- Full settlement math + participation details are published automatically after execution.

**Hidden Until Execution (not shown):**
- Pool capacity `C`, fill ratio `F`, thresholds (`θ_refund/θ_partial/θ_full`)
- Boss + Mobster inventory amounts (`X_boss`, `d_i`, totals)
- Wallet-level participation and any timing indicators

---

## ✅ POST-EXECUTION (FULL DOSSIER) — Public After the Hit Executes

> This is what is published automatically once the hit is completed.

### 🧾 Case File #071 — “The Dockside Dump.”
**Status:** ✅ Closed  
**Tag:** 🟢 CLEAN  
**Target:** Subnet `T=1` (`alpha_1`)  
**District:** San Taovanni — The Docks  
**Heat Window:** 2h 00m  
**Time to Fill:** 37m  
**Execution:** Randomized inside window (audit proof included)

---

### Verifiable randomness (audit-friendly)
Let:
- `B_arm` = chain block when the pool becomes ARMED  
- `Δ_min`, `Δ_max` = min/max delay in blocks (maps to `E_min/E_max`)  
- `R(B_arm)` = chain randomness derived from `B_arm` (runtime-provided randomness source)

Then the execution block is:

$$
B_{exec}=B_{arm}+\Delta_{min}+\Big(R(B_{arm})\ \bmod\ (\Delta_{max}-\Delta_{min}+1)\Big)
$$

This makes execution **unpredictable** to participants, but **deterministic & auditable** after the fact.

---

## Fill Thresholds + Refund / Underfill Fees

Bosses can choose how strict the crew’s fill requirement is.

We support **two threshold modes**:

### Mode 1 (Recommended): 2 thresholds → 3 outcomes
Boss chooses:
- `\theta_{refund}` (refund threshold)
- `\theta_{full}` (full threshold)

Protocol requires:

$$
0 < \theta_{refund} < \theta_{full} \le 1
$$

Outcomes at Heat Window close:

- If `F < \theta_{refund}` → **REFUND**
- If `\theta_{refund} \le F < \theta_{full}` → **EXECUTE (NOT FULL)** (arms and executes, but Boss pays an extra fee)
- If `F \ge \theta_{full}` → **EXECUTE (NORMAL)**

**Suggested defaults (ship-it preset):**
- `\theta_{refund}=0.40`
- `\theta_{full}=0.90`

### Mode 2 (Advanced): 3 thresholds → “tight control”
Boss chooses:
- `\theta_{refund}` (refund)
- `\theta_{partial}` (allow underfilled execution)
- `\theta_{full}` (normal execution)

With:

$$
0 < \theta_{refund} < \theta_{partial} < \theta_{full} \le 1
$$

Outcomes:
- `F < \theta_{refund}` → REFUND  
- `\theta_{refund} \le F < \theta_{partial}` → REFUND (Boss wanted more crew before arming)  
- `\theta_{partial} \le F < \theta_{full}` → EXECUTE (NOT FULL)  
- `F \ge \theta_{full}` → EXECUTE (NORMAL)

### Boss fee schedule (slightly higher fees for REFUND or NOT FULL)
We add small, Boss-only penalties to prevent “free option” spam.

#### A) REFUND fee (Boss-only)
If the pool refunds, deposits are returned, but the Boss pays a **cancellation fee** in MOB-α:

$$
A_{cancel}=f_{cancel}\cdot A_{boss}
$$

Recommended:
- `f_{cancel} = 0.50%` (and optionally a minimum absolute floor)

#### B) Underfilled execution fee (Boss-only)
If the hit executes but is not full, we add a small penalty that scales with how underfilled it is.

Define underfill severity:

$$
U=\text{clamp}\left(\frac{\theta_{full}-F}{\theta_{full}-\theta_{refund}},\;0,\;1\right)
$$

**Option 1 (recommended): Underfill take bump (TAO-side, simple audit)**
Let base take be `t = 1.5%`. For underfilled execution:

$$
t_{eff}=t+\Delta t\cdot U
$$

Recommended: `\Delta t = 0.50%` max bump.

**Option 2 (optional): Underfill burn (MOB-α-side)**
Add an extra Boss burn:

$$
A_{under}=f_{under}\cdot U\cdot A_{boss}
$$

Recommended: `f_{under} = 0.50%` (max when `U=1`).

> **Design intent:** Bosses can allow underfilled execution, but it should cost *slightly more* than a clean, full hit.

---

## Boss Hit Submission (Checklist)

To post a hit, a Boss must specify **timing**, **thresholds**, and **both deposits**:

- **Target subnet `T`** (the `alpha_T` being sold)
- **Heat Window**: `T_fill` and **pool capacity** `C`
- **Fill thresholds** (refund vs execute-not-full vs normal):
  - Mode 1 (recommended): `θ_refund`, `θ_full`
  - Mode 2 (advanced): `θ_refund`, `θ_partial`, `θ_full`
- **Execution Window bounds** (randomized execution after arming):
  - `E_min`, `E_max`
- **Boss deposits**:
  - `A_boss` (MOB-α deposit)
  - `X_boss` (target alpha deposit)

> Full submission form: see **Appendix B — Boss Hit Submission Template**.

---

## Ranks, Families, and Reputation

### Boss Ranks (by successful sponsorship)
Associate → Capo → Underboss → Don

### Mobster Ranks (by successful crew runs)
Runner → Soldier → Made → Enforcer

### Families (Teams)
Mobsters can affiliate with a **Family** (tag/registry). Families have:
- leaderboards (volume, heat, win-rate)
- “made men” lists
- rivalries (optional narrative layer)

### Mobster Reputation (Rep)
Reputation is a rolling score (validators compute & publish it) that reflects:
- participation volume and consistency
- quality outcomes (CLEAN/LEGENDARY bias)
- penalties for griefing/aborts/bad behavior

**Rep affects MOB-α Envelopes only** — never TAO.

---

## Boss “Skin Ratio” (Risk + Upside Slider)

Bosses choose how much target alpha to put up relative to their MOB-α deposit.  
The more target alpha they post, the **less risk** they take on MOB-α and the **more upside** they earn via kickback quality.

We define a **Boss Skin Ratio** using TAO-equivalent accounting comparison:

- `A_boss` = MOB-α deposit  
- `X_boss` = Boss target alpha deposit (units of `alpha_T`)  
- `P0` = pre-hit price of `alpha_T` in TAO (TAO per alpha)  
- `p_alpha` = reference street price of MOB-α in TAO (accounting only)

MOB-α notional:

$$
N_A = A_{boss}\cdot p_{\alpha}
$$

Target-alpha notional:

$$
N_X = X_{boss}\cdot P0
$$

Boss Skin Ratio:

$$
\rho = \frac{N_X}{N_A} = \frac{X_{boss}\cdot P0}{A_{boss}\cdot p_{\alpha}}
$$

### Recommended bands

- **Minimum to open a hit:** `ρ ≥ 0.50`
- **Recommended “serious boss” band:** `ρ = 1.0 – 2.0`
- **Cap benefits:** `ρ ≥ 3.0` (extra target alpha is allowed; benefit stops increasing)

Normalize:

$$
\rho_{norm}=\text{clamp}\left(\frac{\rho-0.50}{2.00-0.50},\,0,\,1\right)
$$

---

## Hit Tags (BOTCHED / MESSY / CLEAN / LEGENDARY)

Tags are primarily determined by **Street Heat** `I'_{hit}` (impact adjusted by depth).

Let `I' = I'_{hit}`:

- **BOTCHED**: `I' < 0.15`  
- **MESSY**: `0.15 ≤ I' < 0.35`  
- **CLEAN**: `0.35 ≤ I' < 0.75`  
- **LEGENDARY**: `I' ≥ 0.75`

---

## Kickback + Street Tax Schedule (Aligned to Tags)

Boss incentives have two tag-aligned levers:
1) **Kickback** (TAO, paid out of `V_hit`) rises with tag quality  
2) **Street Tax** (MOB-α) falls with tag quality  
Then **Boss Skin Ratio `ρ`** improves both (lower risk / more upside).

### Base Boss Kickback `b(I')`

| Tag | Street Heat `I'` | Boss Kickback `b(I')` |
|---|---:|---:|
| BOTCHED | `< 0.15` | `1.00%` |
| MESSY | `0.15 – 0.35` | `1.00% → 2.00%` (linear) |
| CLEAN | `0.35 – 0.75` | `2.00% → 2.75%` (linear) |
| LEGENDARY | `≥ 0.75` | `3.00%` |

$$
b(I')=
\begin{cases}
0.0100 & I' < 0.15\\
0.0100 + 0.0100\cdot\frac{I' - 0.15}{0.20} & 0.15\le I' < 0.35\\
0.0200 + 0.0075\cdot\frac{I' - 0.35}{0.40} & 0.35\le I' < 0.75\\
0.0300 & I' \ge 0.75
\end{cases}
$$

### Base Street Tax

| Tag | Street Heat `I'` | Street Tax `τ(I')` |
|---|---:|---:|
| BOTCHED | `< 0.15` | `5.00%` |
| MESSY | `0.15 – 0.35` | `5.00% → 4.00%` (linear) |
| CLEAN | `0.35 – 0.75` | `4.00% → 3.00%` (linear) |
| LEGENDARY | `≥ 0.75` | `2.50%` |

$$
\tau(I')=
\begin{cases}
0.0500 & I' < 0.15\\
0.0500 - 0.0100\cdot\frac{I' - 0.15}{0.20} & 0.15\le I' < 0.35\\
0.0400 - 0.0100\cdot\frac{I' - 0.35}{0.40} & 0.35\le I' < 0.75\\
0.0250 & I' \ge 0.75
\end{cases}
$$

---

## Skin Ratio Modifiers

### Street Tax discount modifier

$$
m_{\tau}(\rho)=1-0.30\cdot \rho_{norm}
$$

$$
\tau_{eff}(I',\rho)=\tau(I')\cdot m_{\tau}(\rho)
$$

### Kickback multiplier

$$
m_{b}(\rho)=0.90+0.20\cdot \rho_{norm}
$$

$$
b_{eff}(I',\rho)=\min(0.03,\; b(I')\cdot m_{b}(\rho))
$$

### Wash minimum floor

$$
\beta_{min}(\rho)=0.80+0.10\cdot \rho_{norm}
$$

---

## Boss Deposits (What Exactly Is Required)

### 1) MOB-α deposit `A_boss` (bounded-risk deposit)

- **Family Vault:** `v = 2.5%` of `A_boss`
- **Street Tax:** `\tau_{eff}(I',\rho)\cdot A_{boss}` (final burn)
- **Escrow (washable):** remainder, returned per wash formula (bounded by `β_min(ρ)`)

**Street Tax Hold mechanics (boss-friendly):**
- At creation, the protocol holds the **max** possible tax (5% of `A_boss`) as a temporary hold.
- After the hit, the final Street Tax burned is computed using `τ_eff(I',ρ)`.
- Any held amount above the final tax is **rebated back into escrow**.

**Refund / Underfill fees (anti-spam + accountability):**
- See **Fill Thresholds + Refund / Underfill Fees** above.
- Fees are paid by the **Boss**, not by Mobsters.

### 2) Target alpha deposit `X_boss` (boss must be a participant)

- **Family Vault skim (target alpha):** `ν_X·X_boss` where `ν_X ∈ [0.25%, 1.00%]`
- **Sold in hit (if ARMED):** `X'_boss = X_boss - X_vault`

---

## Family Vault Skim (from Boss target alpha)

Vault skim (in target alpha):

$$
X_{vault}=\nu_{X}\cdot X_{boss}
$$

Recommended schedule:

| Tag | `ν_X` (Boss target alpha to vault) |
|---|---:|
| LEGENDARY | `0.25%` |
| CLEAN | `0.50%` |
| MESSY | `0.75%` |
| BOTCHED | `1.00%` |

Boss target alpha sold:

$$
X'_{boss}=X_{boss}-X_{vault}
$$

---

## Hit Flow (What Actually Happens)

### 1) Boss posts a hit
Boss chooses:
- Target subnet `T`
- Heat Window duration `T_fill`
- Fill thresholds (`θ_refund`, `θ_full`) (and optional `θ_partial`)
- MOB-α deposit `A_boss`
- Boss target alpha deposit `X_boss`

### 2) Crew forms (Heat Window: deposits allowed)
Vault skim:

$$
X_{vault}=\nu_{X}\cdot X_{boss}
$$

Boss sold amount:

$$
X'_{boss}=X_{boss}-X_{vault}
$$

Mobsters deposit target alpha `d_i`.

Total filled inventory (pre-arming):

$$
Q_{filled}=X'_{boss}+\sum_i d_i
$$

Fill ratio:

$$
F=\frac{Q_{filled}}{C}
$$

### 3) Heat Window closes → REFUND or ARMED
At Heat Window close, evaluate `F` against thresholds.

- **REFUND:** return `d_i` to Mobsters and `X_boss` (net any vault skim policy you choose), apply Boss cancellation fee `A_cancel`
- **ARMED:** freeze inventory (no more deposits/withdrawals), schedule randomized execution inside `E_min..E_max`

### 4) The hit executes (Execution Window: exact time unknown)
All pooled target alpha is sold in a single batched execution.

Output:
- `V_hit` TAO proceeds
- price moves from `P0` to `P1`

### 5) TAO is split and paid (strict pro-rata by target alpha)

If underfilled penalties are enabled, use `t_eff`; otherwise `t_eff=t`.

Pool pot:

$$
V_{pool}=(1-t_{eff}-b_{eff}(I',\rho))\cdot V_{hit}
$$

TAO payout:

$$
P_{k,TAO}=V_{pool}\cdot \frac{d_k}{Q_{filled}}
$$

Boss total TAO:

$$
P_{boss,total}=b_{eff}(I',\rho)\cdot V_{hit}+P_{boss,TAO}
$$

### 6) The books close (MOB-α side + envelopes)
- Street Heat is calculated
- Street Tax is finalized
- Boss escrow is washed back (bounded)
- Boss fees (refund or underfill) are applied
- Envelopes are distributed (Rep-weighted)
- Dossier is published

## Example Hit Board Card (Dossier)

> What a public Hit Board entry could look like.  
> It reads like lore, but it still audits.

### 🧾 Case File #071 — “The Dockside Dump”
**Status:** ✅ Closed  
**Tag:** 🟢 CLEAN  
**Target:** Subnet `T=1` (`alpha_1`)  
**District:** San Taovanni — The Docks  
**Heat Window:** 2h 00m  
**Time to Fill:** 37m

#### Pool Inventory (Target Alpha)

Boss posted:
- `X_boss = 2,000 alpha_1`
- CLEAN skim `ν_X = 0.50%` → `X_vault = 10 alpha_1`
- Boss sold amount: `X'_boss = 1,990 alpha_1`

Mobsters posted:
- Alice: `5,000`
- Boris: `3,000`
- Cara: `2,000`

Total sold:
- `Q_T = 1,990 + 10,000 = 11,990 alpha_1`

---
## Settlement (TAO) — **strict pro-rata by target alpha**

**Proceeds:** `V_hit = 500 TAO`  
**Taofather take (base 1.5%):** `7.5 TAO`

**Street Heat:** `I' = 0.50` → Tag CLEAN

### Boss skin (for incentives)

Assume accounting inputs:
- `p_alpha = 0.050 TAO / MOB-α`
- `P0 = 0.080 TAO / alpha_1`
- `A_boss = 1,000 MOB-α`

Then:
- `N_A = 1000 * 0.05 = 50 TAO`
- `N_X = 2000 * 0.08 = 160 TAO`
- `ρ = 160 / 50 = 3.2` → capped benefits → `ρ_norm = 1`

### Boss kickback (tag + skin)

Base kickback at `I'=0.50` (CLEAN range):

$$
b(0.50)=0.0200 + 0.0075\cdot\frac{0.50-0.35}{0.40}=0.0228125
$$

Skin multiplier `m_b(ρ)=1.10`:

$$
b_{eff}=b\cdot m_b=0.0228125\cdot 1.10=0.02509375
$$

**Boss Kickback:** `0.02509375 * 500 = 12.546875 TAO`  
**Pool Pot:** `500 - 7.5 - 12.546875 = 479.953125 TAO`

### TAO payouts (only contribution matters)

- Boss (from pool): `479.953125 * (1990 / 11990) ≈ 79.658609 TAO`
- Alice: `≈ 200.147258 TAO`
- Boris: `≈ 120.088355 TAO`
- Cara: `≈ 80.058903 TAO`

Boss total TAO:
- **Boss total TAO = kickback + pool share ≈ 12.546875 + 79.658609 = 92.205484 TAO**

---

## Boss Tribute (MOB-α) — Street Tax + Wash (bounded)

**Boss MOB-α Deposit:** `A_boss = 1,000 MOB-α`

Base Street Tax at `I'=0.50`:

$$
\tau(0.50)=0.0400 - 0.0100\cdot\frac{0.50-0.35}{0.40}=0.03625
$$

Street Tax discount `m_τ(ρ)=0.70`:

$$
\tau_{eff}=0.03625\cdot 0.70=0.025375
$$

Street Tax burned:
- `A_tax = 0.025375 * 1000 = 25.375 MOB-α`

Family Vault (MOB-α side):
- `A_vault = 2.5% * 1000 = 25 MOB-α`

Escrow (washable):
- `A_esc = 1000 - 25 - 25.375 = 949.625 MOB-α`

Wash floor:
- `β_min(ρ) = 0.90`

Returned escrow:

$$
A_{returned}=A_{esc}\cdot\left(\beta_{min}+(1-\beta_{min})\cdot \min(1,\;I')\right)
=949.625\cdot(0.90+0.10\cdot 0.50)=949.625\cdot 0.95=902.14375
$$

Lost escrow:
- `A_lost = 47.48125 MOB-α`

Split loss (`ψ=0.5`):
- `A_wash,burn = 23.740625 MOB-α`
- `A_taofather,blessing = 23.740625 MOB-α`

---

## Envelope (MOB-α) — Rep-weighted “mining reward”

Assume the hit’s envelope pool:
- `E_hit = 4,000 MOB-α`

Assume Mobster Rep shares (normalized):
- Alice `r=0.60`, Boris `r=0.30`, Cara `r=0.10`

Boss “neck bonus” multiplier:
- `η_boss = 1.15`

Illustrative envelope weights (`γ=1`, `δ=1`):

- Boss: `w_boss = (η_boss * X'_boss) = 1.15 * 1990 = 2288.5`
- Alice: `w_A = d_A * r_A = 5000 * 0.60 = 3000`
- Boris: `w_B = 3000 * 0.30 = 900`
- Cara: `w_C = 2000 * 0.10 = 200`

Total weight `W = 6388.5`.

Envelope payouts:
- Boss: `4000 * (2288.5/6388.5) ≈ 1432.887 MOB-α`
- Alice: `≈ 1878.375 MOB-α`
- Boris: `≈ 563.513 MOB-α`
- Cara: `≈ 125.225 MOB-α`

> **Reminder:** TAO payouts ignore Rep. Rep only affects MOB-α envelopes.

### Lore (1-liner)
> “Clean work. Quiet steps. The Docks went silent.”

---

## Why be a Mobster vs just selling alpha alone?

Mobsters earn **two** payouts when they participate in a hit:

1) **TAO** from the batched sale of target alpha — **strictly pro-rata by contributed alpha**  
2) **MOB-α Envelope** — additional “mining reward”, weighted by **contribution + Rep**

### Side-by-side: Solo Sell vs Join the Hit (same inventory, same realized price)

Assume Alice owns:
- `d_A = 5,000 alpha_1`

Assume the market execution outcome is the same in both paths:
- **Realized execution price:** `P_exec = 0.040 TAO / alpha_1`

#### Option A — Sell alpha alone (no hit participation)
TAO_solo = d_A * P_exec
         = 5000 * 0.040
         = 200 TAO
MOB-α_solo = 0

#### Option B — Join the hit as a Mobster (same sale price, plus envelopes)

Because TAO payouts are **strictly pro-rata** and we assumed the same realized price, Alice’s TAO from the hit sale is effectively the same:

- `TAO_hit_from_sale ≈ d_A * P_exec ≈ 200 TAO`

But as a Mobster, Alice also earns **MOB-α Envelope** rewards (Rep-weighted). Using the example dossier envelope math:

- `MOB-α_envelope(Alice) ≈ 1,878.375 MOB-α`

### Comparison:
| Alice’s choice         | TAO received |   MOB-α received | What influences it                                  |
| ---------------------- | -----------: | ---------------: | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Sell alpha alone       |    ≈ 200 TAO |          0 MOB-α | TAO only depends on sale price |
| Join the hit (Mobster) |    ≈ 200 TAO | + 1,878.38 MOB-α | TAO: pro-rata TAO only. MOB-α: contribution + Rep |

Key point: the designed extra upside for Mobsters is the MOB-α envelope.

# Appendix A — The Books (Math & Definitions)

## A1) Boss Deposit Rule (Sizing)

Boss MOB-α deposit can be tied to the notional hit size:

- `Q_T`: total target alpha sold in the hit
- `P0`: pre-hit target alpha price (TAO per alpha)
- `p_alpha`: MOB-α reference street price (TAO per MOB-α)
- `k`: margin factor (MOB-α per 1 TAO of notional)
- `A_min`: minimum deposit

Base:

$$
A_{boss}^{base} = k \cdot \frac{Q_T \cdot P0}{p_{\alpha}}
$$

Minimum:

$$
A_{boss} = \max\left(A_{min},\; A_{boss}^{base}\right)
$$

---

## A2) MOB-α Deposit Split

Let `v = 0.025` be the fixed vault share.

Final tax burn:

$$
A_{tax}=\tau_{eff}(I',\rho)\cdot A_{boss}
$$

Family Vault:

$$
A_{vault}=v\cdot A_{boss}
$$

Escrow:

$$
A_{esc}=A_{boss}-A_{vault}-A_{tax}
$$

---

## A3) Boss Target Alpha Vault Skim

$$
X_{vault}=\nu_X\cdot X_{boss}
$$

$$
X'_{boss}=X_{boss}-X_{vault}
$$

Total sold:

$$
Q_T=X'_{boss}+\sum_i d_i
$$

---

## A4) TAO Settlement

Taofather take (base):

$$
V_{taofather}=t\cdot V_{hit}
$$

Underfilled execution take (optional):

$$
t_{eff}=t+\Delta t\cdot U
$$

Boss kickback:

$$
V_{boss,kick}=b_{eff}(I',\rho)\cdot V_{hit}
$$

Pool pot:

$$
V_{pool}=(1-t_{eff}-b_{eff}(I',\rho))\cdot V_{hit}
$$

TAO paid to any participant `k`:

$$
P_{k,TAO}=V_{pool}\cdot \frac{d_k}{Q_T}
$$

Boss total TAO:

$$
P_{boss,total}=V_{boss,kick}+P_{boss,TAO}
$$

---

## A5) Street Heat

Price shock:

$$
\Delta P = \frac{P0 - P1}{P0}
$$

Normalized shock:

$$
I_{hit}=\min\left(1,\;\max\left(0,\;\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta P_{max}}\right)\right)
$$

Alpha-equivalent depth:

$$
L_T=\frac{R_{TAO,T}}{P0}
$$

Smoothed depth:

$$
L_T^{smooth}=EMA(L_T)
$$

Size-adjusted heat:

$$
I'_{hit}=I_{hit}\cdot \frac{Q_T}{L_T^{smooth}+\epsilon}
$$

---

## A6) The Envelope (MOB-α Rewards)

Epoch envelope pool:

$$
E_{rewards,epoch}\quad (\text{in MOB-}\alpha)
$$

Allocate to hits (example weighting):

$$
s_h=\frac{V_{hit,h}}{\sum_k V_{hit,k}}\cdot \left(1+\kappa\cdot I'_{hit,h}\right)
$$

$$
E_{hit,h}=E_{rewards,epoch}\cdot \frac{s_h}{\sum_j s_j}
$$

Within-hit weights (Rep affects MOB-α only):

$$
r_i=\frac{Rep_i}{\sum_j Rep_j}
$$

Boss weight (neck bonus):

$$
w_{boss}=\left(\eta_{boss}\cdot X'_{boss}\right)^{\gamma}
$$

Mobster weight:

$$
w_i=d_i^{\gamma}\cdot r_i^{\delta}
$$

Payout:

$$
R_{k,MOB\alpha}=E_{hit}\cdot \frac{w_k}{w_{boss}+\sum_i w_i}
$$

---

## A7) Tribute, Wash, and the Blessing

Minimum return:

$$
\beta_{min}(\rho)=0.80+0.10\cdot \rho_{norm}
$$

Returned escrow:

$$
A_{returned}=A_{esc}\cdot\left(\beta_{min}(\rho)+(1-\beta_{min}(\rho))\cdot \min(1,\; I'_{hit})\right)
$$

Lost escrow:

$$
A_{lost}=A_{esc}-A_{returned}
$$

Split loss:

$$
A_{wash,burn}=\psi\cdot A_{lost}
$$

$$
A_{taofather,blessing}=(1-\psi)\cdot A_{lost}
$$

# Appendix B — Boss Hit Submission Template (Create a Job on the Hit Board)

Use this template when posting a hit. It captures every required input: deposits, thresholds, and the (randomized) execution window.

---

## 1) Job Identity
- **Hit Title / Codename:**  
- **Target Subnet `T`:** (netuid + name/symbol if available)  
- **Target Alpha Asset:** `alpha_T`  
- **Reason / Notes (optional):**  

---

## 2) Time Rules (Fill → Armed → Random Execution)

### Heat Window (Fill Phase)
- **Heat Window Duration `T_fill`:** (e.g., `2h 00m`)  
- **Pool Capacity `C` (target alpha units):** (e.g., `50,000 alpha_T`)  
- **Minimum Absolute Inventory `Q_min_abs` (optional, recommended):** (e.g., `5,000 alpha_T`)  

### Execution Window (Armed Phase)
- **Earliest Execution Delay `E_min`:** (e.g., `10m`)  
- **Latest Execution Delay `E_max`:** (e.g., `45m`)  

> Once ARMED, the hit executes at a random time inside `E_min..E_max`. Inventory is frozen.

---

## 3) Fill Thresholds (Refund vs Underfilled Execute vs Normal)

Choose one mode:

### Mode 1 (Recommended): 2 thresholds → 3 outcomes
- **Refund Threshold `θ_refund`:** (suggest `0.40`)  
- **Full Threshold `θ_full`:** (suggest `0.90`)  

Outcomes at Heat Window close:
- If `F < θ_refund` → **REFUND**
- If `θ_refund ≤ F < θ_full` → **EXECUTE (NOT FULL)**
- If `F ≥ θ_full` → **EXECUTE (NORMAL)**

### Mode 2 (Advanced): 3 thresholds → tight control
- **Refund Threshold `θ_refund`:**  
- **Partial-Execute Threshold `θ_partial`:**  
- **Full Threshold `θ_full`:**  

Constraints:
- `0 < θ_refund < θ_partial < θ_full ≤ 1`

Outcomes:
- If `F < θ_refund` → REFUND  
- If `θ_refund ≤ F < θ_partial` → REFUND  
- If `θ_partial ≤ F < θ_full` → EXECUTE (NOT FULL)  
- If `F ≥ θ_full` → EXECUTE (NORMAL)  

---

## 4) Required Deposits (Boss Must Post Both)

### (A) MOB-α Deposit
- **Boss MOB-α Deposit `A_boss`:** `__________ MOB-α`

Notes:
- **Family Vault (fixed):** `v = 2.5%` of `A_boss`
- **Street Tax:** `τ_eff(I', ρ) * A_boss` (final after hit)
- **Street Tax Hold:** protocol temporarily holds max tax (5%) then rebates excess after final tax is computed
- **Escrow:** remainder is washable with floor `β_min(ρ)`

#### Refund / Underfill fees (Boss-paid)
- **Refund fee factor `f_cancel`:** (default `0.50%` of `A_boss`)  
- **Underfilled execution take bump:** `t_eff = t + Δt * U`  
  - **Base take `t`:** `1.5%`
  - **Max bump `Δt`:** (default `0.50%`)  
- *(Optional)* **Underfill burn factor `f_under`:** (default `0.50%`, applied as `f_under * U * A_boss`)

### (B) Target Alpha Deposit
- **Boss Target Alpha Deposit `X_boss`:** `__________ alpha_T`

Notes:
- **Vault skim on boss target alpha:** `X_vault = ν_X * X_boss`
- **Boss sold amount:** `X'_boss = X_boss - X_vault`
- **Recommended `ν_X` schedule:** (LEGENDARY 0.25%, CLEAN 0.50%, MESSY 0.75%, BOTCHED 1.00%)

---

## 5) Boss “Skin Ratio” (Optional to show, recommended)

Accounting inputs (for transparency):
- **Reference MOB-α street price `p_alpha`:** `______ TAO / MOB-α` *(accounting only)*
- **Pre-hit target alpha price `P0`:** `______ TAO / alpha_T`

Compute:
- `N_A = A_boss * p_alpha`
- `N_X = X_boss * P0`
- `ρ = N_X / N_A`
- `ρ_norm = clamp((ρ - 0.50)/(2.00 - 0.50), 0, 1)`

---

## 6) Settlement Defaults (Unless Protocol Overrides)

- **Taofather base take `t`:** `1.5%`
- **Boss kickback:** `b_eff(I', ρ)` (tag-based up to `3%`, skin-adjusted)
- **Street Tax:** `τ_eff(I', ρ)` (tag-based, skin-discounted)
- **Wash floor:** `β_min(ρ) = 0.80 + 0.10 * ρ_norm`

---

## 7) Final Confirmation (What I’m Posting)

**I am posting a hit with:**
- Target subnet `T = ____`
- `T_fill = ____`, `C = ____ alpha_T`, (optional `Q_min_abs = ____`)
- Threshold mode: Mode 1 / Mode 2
- Thresholds: `θ_refund = ____`, `θ_full = ____` (and optional `θ_partial = ____`)
- Execution window: `E_min = ____`, `E_max = ____`
- Deposits: `A_boss = ____ MOB-α`, `X_boss = ____ alpha_T`

**Acknowledgements:**
- Once **ARMED**, inventory is frozen and execution time is randomized within the Execution Window.
- If the pool **REFUNDS**, Mobsters get deposits back and I (the Boss) pay the cancellation fee.
- If the pool executes **NOT FULL**, I (the Boss) pay slightly higher fees (e.g., underfill take bump / optional underfill burn).

---

## Value Proposition

### For MOB-α holders
- Bosses must buy MOB-α to sponsor hits
- Street Tax burns MOB-α (tag + skin adjusted)
- Boss activity increases MOB-α utility and demand

### For Bosses
- Must post real target alpha → real participant
- Earn TAO from target alpha sale **plus** kickback
- Higher `ρ` reduces Street Tax and improves wash floor
- Street Tax Hold rebates excess hold back into escrow
- Boss chooses thresholds + execution window bounds (with penalties for refund / underfill)

### For Mobsters
- TAO payout is strict pro-rata by target alpha
- Envelopes (MOB-α) reward participation + reputation
- Rep increases envelope weight (MOB-α only)

### For Consiglieres
- Publish heat, payouts, and Rep
- Protect the streets from manipulation

### For the Network (Accountability & Rug Resistance)
- **Faster signal on weak subnets:** creates a repeatable, public stress-test mechanism that makes underperforming or low-integrity subnets easier to identify sooner.  
- **Discourages “rug” behavior:** raises the cost of hype-only subnets by forcing faster price discovery and public outcomes that are hard to fake.  
- **Public, auditable transparency:** every hit produces an on-chain / ledger-style record of inventory moved, proceeds, and impact—building a dataset that helps the ecosystem evaluate subnets over time.  
- **Helps expedite pruning of bad subnets:** when a subnet repeatedly shows poor participation, thin liquidity, or negative outcomes, stakeholders and governance get clearer evidence to justify de-weighting, pruning, or reallocating attention to stronger subnets.  
- **Pushes incentives toward real performance:** strong subnets tend to be more resilient; weak subnets are pressured to improve, communicate transparently, or exit.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this financial advice?**  
A: No.

**Q: Is `p_alpha` a peg?**  
A: No. It’s a reference input used for accounting examples, not a guarantee.

**Q: Does the protocol convert MOB-α to TAO?**  
A: No. Hits sell **only target subnet alpha**. MOB-α is used for deposits, burns, escrow, and envelopes.

**Q: Who can post hits or join crews?**  
A: Anyone.

**Q: When exactly does an ARMED hit execute?**  
A: Once ARMED, it executes at a **random time** between **15 minutes** and **7200 minutes (5 days)** after arming. The exact time is not shown in advance.

**Q: Can someone deposit right before execution to game it?**  
A: No. Once the pool is **ARMED**, inventory is frozen (no deposits/withdrawals). Execution time is also randomized.

**Q: Why can a Boss allow “execute-not-full”?**  
A: It lets Bosses trade “speed and certainty” for “crew fullness.” Underfilled execution costs the Boss **slightly higher fees** to discourage spam and sloppy jobs.

**Q: Who pays refund / underfill penalties?**  
A: The **Boss** only. Mobsters don’t pay penalties for a refund; their inventory is returned.

**Q: Why does Street Tax depend on heat?**  
A: To incentivize Bosses to aim for **clean hits**: better heat lowers tax and increases kickback.

**Q: Does Mobster reputation affect TAO payouts?**  
A: No. TAO is strict pro-rata by target alpha. Rep only affects MOB-α envelopes.

**Q: What are the two payouts again?**  
A: **TAO** (from selling target alpha) and **MOB-α** (envelopes, Rep-weighted).
